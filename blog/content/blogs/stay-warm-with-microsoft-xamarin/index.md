For those in New Zealand, Microsoft and Xamarin have announced some cool events:


Brr! It’s getting cold outside. Microsoft has a plan to get you through winter with some awesome Xamarin events and competitions and apparel!

Are you ready to sharpen your skills in a fun, fast-paced environment? Microsoft is hosting FREE Xamarin training events around New Zealand! Xamarin lets you write code once for a mobile app and deploy it to Android, iOS and Windows in one go. We’ll teach you how to build on the same tool top Fortune 500 companies use, and help you make your next big app!

To keep you warm, we’ve got limited edition Xamarin Beanies for every event attendee, completed with limited edition Xamarin socks for every competition entry. The top app developers also get Xbox Ones and hard cash to splurge over the winter months!

I had a great time hosting an iBeacon mini-hack with the [Birmingham Xamarin Mobile Cross Platform User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Birmingham-Xamarin-Mobile-Cross-Platform-User-Group/).  A big thanks to [Dave Evans](https://twitter.com/DaveDev) for organising this.

It was only a small group, which was great as I had enough [Estimote](http://www.estimote.com) iBeacons to give away to everyone.  Due to hardware issues and phones not being set up we only got one app built, but everyone seemed to have fun.  I'll be planning a whole day hackathon soon so that more people can try them out and build some cool apps.

I've put the slides up on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/JimBennett10/xamarin-ibeacon-minihack) and embedded them below.

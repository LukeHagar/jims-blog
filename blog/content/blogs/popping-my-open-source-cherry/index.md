Today the pull request for my first ever contribution to someone else's open source project was accepted and merged.

It was a small bug fix to [Framework7](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/) - a really cool HTML5 framework for building iOS 7 style apps.  I'm using it for my first cordova project and what it outputs looks just like a native iOS 7 app.  Highly recommended.

A big thank you to [Vladimir Kharlampidi](https://github.com/nolimits4web) for creating this project.

Even though my fix was small, I did feel a bit nervous once I commited it.  Would it be accepted or laughed at.  It was quite a rush when I got the email saying it had been merged.

One done, many more to come.

As a change from talking about iBeacons at events, I've decided to start a series of YouTube videos covering a number of topics around iBeacons.

My first one, an introduction to building your first iBeacon app using Xamarin.iOS is now up on YouTube!  You can check it out below.

This is my first one, so would appreciate any feedback.

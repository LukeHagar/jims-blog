This year is the 44th annual [Telly Awards](https://www.tellyawards.com). The Telly Awards honor excellence in video and television across all screens.

The Telly Awards was founded in 1979 to honor excellence in local, regional and cable television commercials with non-broadcast video and television programming added soon after. With the recent evolution and rise of digital video (web series, VR, 360 and beyond), the Telly Awards today also reflects and celebrates this exciting new era of the moving image on and offline.

The Telly Awards annually showcases the best work created within television and across video, for all screens. Receiving over 12,000 entries from all 50 states and 5 continents, Telly Award winners represent work from some of the most respected advertising agencies, television stations, production companies and publishers from around the world. The Telly Awards recognizes work that has been created on the behalf of a client, for a specific brand and/or company (including your own) or self-directed as a creative endeavor.

This year we entered the **Build a 3D Printed Clippy Powered by ChatGPT from OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services** episode of Let's get personal: computing, and we won a [Silver award in the online talk show/interview category](https://www.tellyawards.com/winners/2023/online/general-talk-show-interview)!

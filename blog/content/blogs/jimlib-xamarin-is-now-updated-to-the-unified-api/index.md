Finally, after fighting with Xamarin and having my Surface die and need to be reinstalled twice, I've managed to get [JimLib.Xamarin](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/JimLib.Xamarin) updated to use the new Xamarin Unified API so it should be suitable for submitting new apps to the iPhone app store.  I'll be updating my first app [Second Screen for Plex](https://appsto.re/i6Bw6St) soon and sending it to the app store for approval and will update with the results.  After all, you never know what weird and wonderful things the app store approval process will turn up.

This is in GitHub, and updated on NuGet.

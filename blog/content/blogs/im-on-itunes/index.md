As mentioned [before](/blogs/technical-tests/), I wrote a guest post for [Core Java Interview Questions](http://www.corejavainterviewquestions.com) all about technical testing as part of the interview process.  Sam, the sites editor, has been doing a podcast for the site and was kind enough to invite me along to discuss my blog post with him for an episode.  What was meant to be a 20 minute chat turned in to an hour discussing everything from technical tests to the advantages of being an expat.

You can grab it by subscribing to the podcast on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/core-java-interview-questions/id949010155?mt=2) (I'm on episode 4) or direct from the website http://www.corejavainterviewquestions.com/podcast4/.

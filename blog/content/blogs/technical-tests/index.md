A good friend of mine, [Sam](http://samatkinson.com), has started an awesome site for Java developers to help with the always enjoyable process of interviewing.

It's available at:

http://www.corejavainterviewquestions.com

He was nice enough to ask me to do a guest post, so not being a Java programmer I decided to post about doing technical tests - something nice and language agnostic.  The post is question is here:

Have a read and provide any feedback.  Always happy to discuss these tests so tweet me at @jimbobbennett with any questions.

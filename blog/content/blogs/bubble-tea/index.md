After a post on FaceBook about enjoying some Bubble Tea, a friend of mine suggested that I should blog about it.  
Seeing as I am currently in Thailand, home of the best food in the world, I guess it makes sense to extend this to all food.  Most of my meals are incredible food cooked fresh and purchased from markets for usually 40p-80p a dish - so why not share them with the world.

I'll start today with bubble tea - read about it on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea) if you've never heard of it.  Essentially it's a Taiwanese drink made of milky tea with tapioca pearls in the bottom, but there are many variants made with green tea, fruit teas, juices and jellies instead of bubbles.

This morning I stopped at the Bubble Boy (a chain of Bubble Tea stands) at the [Ekkami BTS station](https://goo.gl/maps/rZQtC).

I grabbed a Chocolate milk tea with chocolate pudding at the bargain price of 45 baht (83p/$1.40).  It's really, really nice - you can't taste the tea that much, just a milky chocolate drink with undertones of bitter dark chocolate.  The chocolate pudding is dark chocolate flavour pearls that are nice and chewy without a too intense taste.  Definitely one I'll have again.

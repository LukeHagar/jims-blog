As the title really, why can't all laptops use the same charger - including laptops from the same company.

I've trvelled 45 minutes to the co-working space I'm working at only to find I've forgotten my MacBook Pro charger, and it's only got 10% left.  I have my Surface and the charger for that, but of course it's not the same.  I can't even borrow one as the only free chargers here are for MacBook Airs - different plug.  This means I'll be heading back home soon.

Why can't they all just use the same charger - like with phones where the EU has pushed for all phones to use mini-usb to charge.  If we could have a USB spec that provides enough voltage for the laptop to charge then have them all using USB chargers then life would be so much easier.

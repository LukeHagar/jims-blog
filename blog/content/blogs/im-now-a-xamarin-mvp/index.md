I'm very proud to have been recognised as a Xamarin MVP!  Thanks to whoever nominated me.  I hope the work I've been doing for the community through my talks and blog has helped some people, and will continue to do so in the future.  Look out for my up coming talks in New Zealand and at [Evolve](https://evolve.xamarin.com), and my upcoming blog posts and (hopefully) book.

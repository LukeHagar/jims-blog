Just a quick post to wish you all a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.  Or a happy Saturnalia, or Festivus, or however you celebrate at this time of year.

I'll be spending the time playing with a few things.  I'm looking forward to seeing how well [Resharper 9](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) works with Xamarin.Forms, and playing with my [Estimote](http://www.estimote.com) iBeacons.  I'll also hopefuly be recording a podcast for [Core Java Interview Questions](http://www.corejavainterviewquestions.com) with my friend Sam, and will be blogging about it all.

See you in the new year!

The MEAP of my book, Xamarin In Action, has just been updated to include a new chapter covering building cross-platform view models. This chapter talks about how you can use view models to increase the amount of cross-platform, unit testable code in your Xamarin app by moving UI logic away from the platform specific layers down into your cross-platform code.

To celebrate you can get 50% off my book for one week only. Head to http://xam.jbb.io and use the code *mlbennett*.

Not sure if this is the book for you? Well if you are building or plan to build Xamarin apps then yes, this is the book for you. Rather than being a dry reference book that replicates what is in the on-line docs, this instead teaches you how to build and ship production quality Xamarin apps from idea to the store. I teaches MVVM as a way to ramp up the amount of cross-platform code in your app - after all large amounts of code sharing is the killer feature of Xamarin!

This book is still being written, so if you buy it now you get the first 8 chapters, with new chapters as they are being written, and you can get involved with making the book better by giving feedback and suggesting improvements.

You can download the first chapter for free from [here](https://manning-content.s3.amazonaws.com/download/8/a45b766-0a46-417f-8afa-724107f1c415/Bennett_Xamarin_MEAP_V05_ch1.pdf). You can also read an excerpt all about MVVM on [DZONE](https://dzone.com/articles/mvvm-the-design-pattern-for-xamarin-apps), [Medium](https://medium.com/@jimbobbennett/mvvm-the-design-pattern-for-xamarin-apps-9781e60ef587#.ibzk4lehv) or [my own blog](/blogs/mvvm-the-design-pattern-for-xamarin-apps/) (whichever is your preference).

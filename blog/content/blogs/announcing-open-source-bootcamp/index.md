I'm excited to announce the publication of a 2-day open source bootcamp in a box!

<div class="github-card" data-github="open-source-bootcamp" data-width="400" data-height="" data-theme="default"></div>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

This boot camp was put together by [Sam Wronski](https://hachyderm.io/@runewake2), [Austin Akers](https://twitter.com/tweetmonster999) and I, with help and support from GitHub, GitHub campus experts, and others from the open source community.

## Goals

The goal of this bootcamp is to take attendees from a very basic to no understanding of GitHub on a journey to not only being comfortable with collaborating on GitHub, but being ready to actively contributing to public open source projects, or to collaborate on code in the workplace. This bootcamp is structured as an in-person event.

The code the attendees will be working on is relatively basic JavaScript, and attendees without JavaScript knowledge but with some knowledge of programming should still be able to successfully complete this bootcamp.

## Running this event

<div class="github-card" data-github="open-source-bootcamp/bootcamp-guide" data-width="400" data-height="" data-theme="default"></div>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

[This GitHub repo](https://github.com/open-source-bootcamp/bootcamp-guide) contains the full instructions on how to run this event, with guides for the day, slide decks, a sample project to work on with full instructions, videos of the sessions, and plenty of suggestions on how to make this day a success. This bootcamp is fully open source and MIT licensed, so you can take it and run it at your own event without cost or attribution.

When we have run this event in the past (such as at the [In-person Student Open Source Bootcamp](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-redmond/events/287024832/), [Hacktoberfest in-person open source bootcamp](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-redmond/events/288635090/), and the [Fall in love with Open Source bootcamp](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-redmond/events/290700609/), all hosted at the [Microsoft Reactor in Redmond](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-redmond/events/287024832/)). The attendees have all given feedback that networking is important, therefore this event includes opportunities for attendees to work together on code, be involved in networking 

## Let me know what you think!

If this bootcamp is of use to you, please let me know! If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, please start a [discussion in the GitHub org](https://github.com/orgs/open-source-bootcamp/discussions).

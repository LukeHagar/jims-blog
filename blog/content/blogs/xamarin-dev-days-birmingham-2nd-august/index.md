Xamarin have announced they are doing their first European [Dev Day](http://xamarin.com/dev-days) in Birmingham, hosted by the Birmingham Mobile Cross Platform User Group.  This is a great user group organised by [Dave Evans](https://twitter.com/davedev), and recently they kindly allowed by to [jabber on at them about iBeacons](/blogs/the-slides-from-my-ibeacon-mini-hack-are-now-available/).

Details and tickets are available here:

I'm very excited by this - the team who will be there are a great bunch, and if you come along you also get the opportunity to meet me!  And who would pass up on that ;op
I'll be in town Saturday night through till Monday, so if you're there and fancy a beer/curry etc. then give me a shout.

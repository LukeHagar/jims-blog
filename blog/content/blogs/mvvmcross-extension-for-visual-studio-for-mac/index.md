I've been working to update the MvvmCross Xamarin Studio add-in to work with Visual Studio for Mac. The add-in has been updated thanks to some help from [Matthew Robbins](https://twitter.com/matthewrdev), the author of the awesome [MFractor add-in](http://www.mfractor.com), which if you don't have you **MUST** get, it's awesome.

This add-in is now available from the VS for Mac extension manager!

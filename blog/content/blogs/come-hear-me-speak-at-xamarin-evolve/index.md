If you're going to [Xamarin Evolve 2016](https://evolve.xamarin.com) this year then come and hear me talk!  I'll be speaking about using iBeacons and Eddystone in your apps including showing how to use beacons to find a hidden monkey- and giving away a few beacons to anyone who who can find the monkey.

The beacons I will be using will be from [Estimote](http://estimote.com) - they make fantastic hardware and software and have pushed beacons above and beyond what they were meant to do to allow you to do some awesome things.  If you want to buy beacons, be sure to check them out.  I have no affiliation with them, I don't get anything if you buy their beacons, they just are that awesome that they are worth shouting about.

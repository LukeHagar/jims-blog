My second NuGet package is now available: [JimLib.Xamarin](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JimBobBennett.JimLib.Xamarin/).  This contains a selection of helpers to make developing iOS apps with Xamarin easier (WinPhone/Android will come later when I have an Android license/Android device/Windows Phone device to test on).

It's all open source - code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/JimLib.Xamarin), symbols are also available (as talked about [here](/blogs/symbols-for-nuget-packages/)).

Grab it and give it a spin.  Contributions/criticism/pull requests/money/beer always welcome.

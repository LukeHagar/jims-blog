Finally, after 2 years since I first put pen to paper (well, put keystroke to [Atom](https://atom.io)), [Xamarin in Action](http://xam.jbb.io) is done and available from your favorite bookseller as a printed, paper book, with a forward from my good friend, the amazing [James Montemagno](https://twitter.com/JamesMontemagno)!

This book is designed to teach you how to build a production quality Xamarin app, from idea through implementation and testing, to the store and beyond. It doesn't cover just a list of UI widgets with lists of properties and methods, instead it focuses on building real world, well written, testable apps using MVVM. It covers using traditional Xamarin for iOS and Android, looking at how to maximize the amount of cross-platform code in your app, how to build UIs using Android XML and iOS Storyboards, how to share and unit test your UI logic, and how to test your UI. It then shows how to use [AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms) to build, test and distribute your app, as well as monitor usage and crashes after publication. 

Here's some things that people have said about this book:

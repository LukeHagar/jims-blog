> Come as you are, do what you love

I've been asked a few times for thoughts and tips around getting an internship at Microsoft. So in the spirit of "I didn't have time to reply to you so I wrote this blog post", I thought I'd provide a stack of resources useful to folks wanting to know more about the process.

# Application

Interested in an internship here at Microsoft? The first port of call is the [University internship Careers site](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/usuniversityinternship/?WT.mc_id=internships-blog-jabenn). This is the US site, and we have similar sites globally so if you are looking outside the US then head to [careers.microsoft.com](https://careers.microsoft.com) and search for international internship opportunities.

This site has a wealth of information around the program, as well as a link to apply. Get those applications in now!

# The interview process

This is a question I often get asked - what is the interview process? It varies depending on the type of role, and I'm not a recruiter so I can't talk officially on the topic, but there are some great posts from former interns that might help shed some light on it.

The main thing is to come as you are and do what you love - out mantra for recruiting. Let your passions shine through, talk about the projects you are most proud of, the work you do outside the classroom, hacks you attend. Be aware of Microsoft and its culture. And most importantly, be yourself.

# Life as an intern

You've made it through the interview and have an internship. So what's it like here?

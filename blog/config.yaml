    content: |-
      I am a Regional Cloud Advocate focusing on building out and skilling communities in the Pacific North West, with a focus on the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond, Washington, as well as a passion for the internet of things, edge computing and TinyML. I'm British, so I sound way smarter than I actually am.
      
      In the past I've lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. I've spoken at conferences and events all around the globe, organised meetup groups and communities, and written a book on mobile development.

      I also hate and am allergic to cats, but I have a 9-year-old daughter who loves cats, so I have 2 cats.

The custom vision service recently has been updated to include object detection, and this allows you to train the service to detect multiple objects inside an image with their locations, instead of just being a simple classifier. Jim walks through creating an object detection model, tagging regions in images that show the objects to be detected, then he builds a simple Xamarin app to use this to annotate a picture from his daughters toybox, naming all the toys it finds.
